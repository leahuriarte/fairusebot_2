ABOUT THE 
MLA STYLE
 
 
The 
MLA
 
style is one of a number of styles of refe rencing or bibliographic citation 
that
 
is used widely for 
acade mic writing
, particularly in the humanities
. 
MLA uses an 
author
-
pag e
 
syste m 
of in
-
text citation, 
e.g. 
(Mullan
 
24
)
, a nd a Works Cited list at the end of the document. The MLA style is ve ry 
flexible,
 
thus
 
y ou 
may occasionally need to improvise by using other MLA refere nce examples to cite le ss common 
refere nce types. It is most important to be consistent.
 
 
 
This guide covers basic explanations and examples for the most common types of citations used by 
students. This citation guide is base d on 
the 
MLA Handbo ok (8th editio n)
.

TEXT CI
TATION: REFERENCING 
SOURCES WITHIN THE T
EXT 
 
Throug hout the text of your 
paper
 
you ne ed to acknowle dge the sources 
you used to write your paper
. 
Whene ver you prese nt a sta tement of evide nce such a s a quote, or whe n you use some one e
lse's idea s, 
opinions or theories in your own words (paraphrasing), you must acknowle dge your sources. 
S
ome 
exa mples of 
how to 
cit
e
 
sources 
within your 
paper
 
are giv en be low.
 
 
If you use the name of the author(s) in your writing , place the 
page numbers
 
of 
the work
 
in pare ntheses 
where there is a natural pause in the te xt
 
e .g.
,
 
at the end of a se ntence.
 
 
Mullan describe d narration as
–
(40)
.
 
 
If you re fer to 
a work
 
in the text of your paper, place the author's last name and the 
pa ges of the work
 
in 
pa renthese
s at the e nd of the sentence
 
e. g.
 
 
The narration of works ca n be divide d into two
–
 
(Mullan 40).
 
 
Note : When y ou 
summarise
 
the genera l idea of a source in your ow n words, you must cite the author a nd 
page(s) as shown
 
abov e
. 
 
If you 
provide a 
direct quote 
fewe r tha n 4 line s
,
 
e nclose the quotation 
with
 
double
 
qu
otation marks 
within the text.
 
The 
pa ge number(s)
 
of 
the quote(s)
 
should be provided in pare nthese s
 
immediately a fter 
the quote
.
 
If both quotes in the same se nte nce are separa ted by only a fe w 
words,
 
and are taken from the 
same pa ge reference , place the pa ge numbe r at the end of the sentence only. 
 
 
Mullan explained that at times ﬁtone is allﬂ (213) and should be ﬁanti
-
sole mnﬂ (215). 
 
 
If the quotation is 
more than four 
lines
 
it should be displa yed i
n 
an
 
indente d block (
0.5 inches
 
or 
1.
2
7
 
cm)
 
without
 
quotation marks.
 
It should usually be introduced in y our own words with a colon.
 
Pa ge numbers 
are placed in 
pa rentheses,
 
but note that this is placed a fter the full stop in this case.

James is making an argument about a singular novel, but that last phrase is evidence 
enoug h of his disda in for the form in gene ra l. He expresse s this else where in his criticism 

and correspondence , notably in an e xtraordinary letter to H. G.
 
Wells. In 
1911
 
Wells ha d

ELECTRONIC ITEMS 
 
When referencing electronic 
resources,
 
it is necessa ry to prov ide details about the location of the item. 
A 
DOI (D
igital Object Ide ntifier) remains attached to a source ev en if a U
RL cha nges therefore MLA advises 
to use a DOI in y our refere nce if one ha s been assigned by the publisher.
 
 
In the abse nce of a DOI i
nclude a 
sta ble U RL
 
(also called a permalink
, bookma rk or embedde d link
) 
in 
your entry 
if you have accessed 
the resource
 
through a da tabase that is not publically accessible
,
 
i.e. 
requires a login.
 
If there is no option to 
retrieve
 
a stable URL on the database 
pa ge,
 
then use
 
the U RL
 
that 
is displaye d in the address bar of your browser. 
When providing the U RL
,
 
omit http:// or https://.
 
The 
na me of the

(if applicable) 
is
 
prov ided
 
in italics
 
before the
